# My Testing Rules
1) Created a test File or new Test Sweet for each component
2.1) When Creating a new component use the enzyme library from airbnb to render 
    ''' import { shallow } from 'enzyme' '''
    2.2) Shallow rendering is useful to constrain yourself to testing a component as a unit, and ensure that your test aren't inserting behavior on the child components.

 
## Test Basic Render: 
- Table
- Routes
- NavBar
- Home
- EvaluationForm
- ConfigurationForm
- EvaluationList
- ConfigurationList
- Cell
- Row
- GpsField
- ResultForm
