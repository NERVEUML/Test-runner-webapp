# My Testing Rules
* Created a test File or new Test Sweet for each component
* When Creating a new component use the enzyme library from airbnb to render 
    ''' import { shallow } from 'enzyme' '''
    * Shallow rendering is useful to constrain yourself to testing a component as a unit, and ensure that your test aren't inserting behavior on the child components.

 
## Test Basic Render: 
- Routes
- NavBar
- Home
- EvaluationForm
- ConfigurationForm
- EvaluationList
- ConfigurationList
- GpsField
- ResultForm
- Timer
